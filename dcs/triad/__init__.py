"""TRIAD — Conformance × Coherence × Coordination as one algebra.

Every verification resolves to a state in Belnap's FOUR, composed
pointwise across three orthogonal axes. The composition is a
distributive bilattice: commutative, associative, idempotent,
monotone in two orders, distributive. Every result emits a
proof-carrying receipt checkable without re-running the check.
